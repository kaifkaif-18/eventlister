          <h3>About</h3>
          <hr>
          <p>Asha Bhosle is one of India`s finest and most versatile playback singers, with innumerable accolades and laurels to her name. She was born in a small village in Maharashtra. Her father, the late Deenanath Mangeshkar was a renowned theatre artist and classical singer who passed away when she was nine. This prompted Asha and her sister Lata Mangeshkar to take up acting and singing to support their family. She made her singing debut with the Marathi film Majha Bal (1943).Ashaâ€™s first brush with success was with the song Nanhe Munhe Bacche, for the movie Boot Polish (1954). By this time, her sister Lata was already a prominent figure in the Hindi film industry. Asha enjoyed a successful phase during the 50s and the 70s.</p>
